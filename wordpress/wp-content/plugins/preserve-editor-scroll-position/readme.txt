Recovers the old scroll position in your Editor after saving. Either HTML or visual editor.

== Description ==

Every time you edit and save a post the page will be reloaded. That means all scroll positions will be resetted.
Not really UX friendly.

This plugin recovers the old scroll position in your Editor after saving. Either HTML or visual editor.

**Sounds pretty good? Install now!**
