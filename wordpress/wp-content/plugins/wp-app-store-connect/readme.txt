== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the latest templates? =

You can find the latest templates on http://appdamit.de/wp-app-store-connect-templates

When upgrading, the plugin does not override your previously saved templates (or other options). 

= On the front page / index page / archive pages I only see the shortcode [appstore id="..."] but not data for this app? =

This is due to the nature of wordpress. Wordpress doesn't execute shortcodes when compiling excerpts of posts (text before more-tag) to an index page (frontpage or archives). It just takes the text directly from the database and ignores shortcodes. To show the content of a shortcode you have to tweak your theme's index page. There is no universally valid way as every theme might work a bit different.

On the admin panel, you need to have a look at Design -> Editor, which show all the templates of your theme. Usually you have a template called 'index.php' which puts the frontpage together. In this template (could be named depending on your theme) there is usually something like

 while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();

also known as 'the loop': http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop

Wordpress fetches posts from the database and does something with them, like putting them on the front page. At this point you would instruct wordpress to execute any shortcodes in the post by inserting

 $post->post_content = do_shortcode($post->post_content);

The new line should read

 while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); $post->post_content = do_shortcode($post->post_content);

Whenever fiddling with templates, you need to have back-ups of the working template as syntax errors in a central template will bring down the whole blog (500 Internal Server Error).
